<help>Procedurally Generated Race 
by Discoordination Journey 
2024 (c) Discoordination Laboratories

Every time you start the map, the script generates a new route for the race! 
The race includes all vehicles available in the game. 
The randomizer selects various parameters for the map: type of transport, route, 
skin, weather, environment and even the size of the moon. 
There are separate leaderboards available for each vehicle, which are usually accessible by pressing the F5 button. 
The more you play this map, the more the script learns new points to build future routes. 

Commands:
/votesave — command to save the map so you can play it later on the 'Player For Generated Races' map
/voteskip — command to start a vote that skips a checkpoint for all players, if this checkpoint is unattainable
